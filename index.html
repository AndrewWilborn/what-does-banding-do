        <h2>A Brief History of Banding</h2>
        <p>Banding is one of the 7 keywords introduced in the original 1993c release of Magic the Gathering.  The keyword appears on 41 different cards and is primarily associated with the color White.  The reason the keyword appears on so few cards despite being around since the beginning of Magic is because it was discontinued early on in the game's history for being too complicated.</p>

        <h2>What does banding even do?</h2>
        <p>Part of what makes banding so complicated is that it actually does two different things.  The first part of banding allows any number of creatures with banding, and up to one without, to attack in a band.  Bands are blocked as a group, meaning if a creature blocks one of the members of the band, that creature is now blocking the entire band. This is the most obvious part of banding and its where the name comes from.  The second part of banding is that if any creature with banding is in combat with a creature, you choose how the opposing creature divides its damage instead of its controller.
