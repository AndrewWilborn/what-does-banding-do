        <p>Amy declares her 1/3 Benalish Infantry and her 2/2 Grizzly Bears to be attacking in a band, and Bob decides to block with his 3/3 Hill Giant.  Normally, Bob would be able to choose to assing his damage to either Benalish Infantry first, or the Grizzly Bears first in order to kill one of Amy's creatures.  However because Benalish Infantry has banding, as a result, Amy can divide the damage in ways that normally would not be possible.  By assinging 2 of Hill Giant's damage to Benalish Infantry, and the remaining 1 damage to her Grizzly Bears, both of Amy's creatures will be able to survive combat.</p>

        <p>Bob attacks Amy with his Blightsteel Colossus and Amy blocks with a Benalish Hero.  Normally Trample would allow Bob to assign the excess damage from Blightsteel Colossus to be delt to Amy during combat.  However, banding allows Amy to choose how Blightsteel Colossus assigns it's damage.  This means she can choose to assign all 11 damage to her Benalish Hero, allowing her to survive.</p>
